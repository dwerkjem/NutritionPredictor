# Nutrition Predictor

Given some data about a food item, this program will predict its nutrition facts. The data is taken from the USDA FoodData Central API. The program will ask the user for as many details as possible about the food item, and then it will predict the missing values. The user can also provide the missing values if they know them. The program will display the predicted nutrition facts of the food item along with the probability of the prediction.
